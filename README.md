# PowerShell Scripts

This is a simple repo of some PowerShell scripts I have collected over
my time work on the Navy Flank Speed tenant. Some of these are old
and I've since written cleaner scripts, but they are good reminders
of how some things are/were done.

The best script in here is the Depo.psm1 custom module. I utilzied this
to query the DoD's identity management API to get user details, entitlement
information, and make changes to said entitlements.
